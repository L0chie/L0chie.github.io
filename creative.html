      <p>
        In the beginning there was nothing.<br>
        Infinite darkness that stretched beyond comprehension.<br>
        Infinite nothingness except for its presence...<br><br>

        These words echo through the entities conscious. Suddenly, an unknown force compels it to slam its hands together. It complies and a most brilliant light explodes, permanently illuminating the darkness and expands to fill the once empty void with spinning light and matter. The entity waves its hands and the newly created forces of time beckon to its will. Constellations rush past at unfathomable speed, planets are created and destroyed and then it stops. Time ticks at normal pace. It spends a few hours tinkering with its creations. Fascinated by the grand optical spectacle of supernova’s and neutron stars. The being moves through the universe expressing its satisfaction. It watches as an asteroid whizz’s by and slams into a small rocky planet on the outer reaches of this particular solar system. The planet temporarily superheats and explodes into a million different shards of rock, forming an asteroid belt. The entity turns around and its gaze rests upon a little blue and green planet. It looks beautiful, not unlike its own... <br><br>

        Time speeds to a few thousand years a second, the entity cuts rivers and lakes into the ground of the little blue and green planet. Mountains are raised and it watches as life begins to emerge. First in the oceans, offspring of deep sea volcanic vents. The simple cellular creatures colonise the waters. Food chains develop and the circle of life prevails. The creatures begin to grow larger and more complex. The entity witness’s schools of fish darting around the oceans chased by sea borne predators. And then it progresses. Life takes its first step on dry land and shortly thereafter the first humans. <br><br>

        The entity is weary now, its spends most of its time walking around the world it created. Guiding the growth of humanity and its civilisation. From simple nomadic tribes simple, they are now in the ages of knights and kings. Human conflict and suffering is omnipresent. The entity, unhappy with its creation destroying itself, establishes some form of communication. Soon, it is worshipped and loved by its creation. Time now speeds to a decade a second. Slowing down to end wars, create rain over their farms or otherwise help its creation thrive, delighting in the advances they make <br><br>

        Suddenly, there is a faint ringing. The entity lets off an audible sigh that was heard all throughout the little blue and green planet. It took off the VR equipment and was promptly transported back to the real world. The man’s phone was still ringing and buzzing. It was a call from his mother, seemingly urgent as it was the first in many years. The man answered. The news broke the man’s heart. His father had died of a heart attack. The man reassures his mother before promising to leave and go and comfort her. The call ending, the man does his best to quickly clean himself up. Looking in the mirror he is unrecognisable with baggy red eyes, unkempt hair and a scrappy beard attributed to the game he spent the last 4 weeks playing and compounded by the recent tragedy. The picture of his dad on the bedside table haunted him like a ghost as the man recollected their times together which was tainted by the man’s gaming addiction to which he was blinded of the consequences. A tear rolled down his face and he went off to comfort his mother. <br><br>

        After a day, the man returns home. Still in shock over the unexpected death of his father and his world awry he returns to the world he created. Comforted by his in game powers and control. The world is still running in his VR headset. He rushes to get back into it and the man transforms into the entity. <br><br>

        A few hundred thousand years had elapsed, unchecked, uncorrected and unapproved. His mountains are gone, replaced by deep mines and metal refinery plants spewing toxins and polluting the surroundings. All the trees are gone, where once was beautiful lush forest now there was only concrete and metal. The rivers, formerly clear turquois were now cloudy and dark. No fish swim and no birds fly. The people have forgotten the entity. No longer was he worshipped, nor its lessons remembered. No matter what course of action the man took to help this new age they don’t notice his work. If he raises their crops to deliver greater yield, the governments confiscate the food. If he fills the oceans with plenty of large fish, great nets scoop them all and still no one notices or cares about the entity. <br><br>

        Miracle after miracle is performed yet still they don’t acknowledge the entity. His creation is at war with itself too. Each side committing horrible crimes against each other. Food for the majority is scarce, hoarded by the government. Entire families are put into camps of death. The man, so disheartened by his creations 'progress' decides to end it, and set another planet on a collision course with this one. As his world is burning and the people are crying out for a god to save them, he takes off his VR equipment, and turns off his computer. The man had a strange feeling. A mixture between guilt, regret and realisation. Something inside him had changed which compelled him to visit his mother the next day and re-establish their relationship. <br><br>
